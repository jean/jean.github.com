<h1 id="toc_1">Plone Development Layouts</h1>

<p>
Setting up a Plone development environment is quite a complicated business.
For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You need to have the right Python version,
</li>
<li>
with the right level of isolation from the system Python 
</li>
<li>
as well as from other locally compiled Pythons. 
</li>
<li>
You need suitably compiled <code>libxml2</code>, <code>libjpeg</code>, <code>zlib</code>, etc.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There have been various attempts to address this, none yet revealed as the
Right Way. Ã‰rico Andrei <a href="http://lists.plone.org/pipermail/plone-product-developers/2012-March/011310.html">nails</a> it:
</p>
<blockquote>
Last night while talking to Clayton and Liz about the whole
ZopeSkel/Paster/Templer/Crushinator situation it became clear that the
story for new developers is a complete mess.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
There are good ideas, great developers and high expectations. There
isn't a working solution. Some people jumped on Templer, most people
still need to pin ZopeSkel &lt;2.99 (damn local commands).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This is bad, and having a new shiny thing that "eases" Plone
development just made the situation even worse -- as long as someone
must use it and then &lt;zopeskel create&gt; &amp; &lt;paster addcontent&gt;.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Time to kill most of the available options, focus on <strong>just one</strong> and
have a compelling story to tell to newcomers.

</dl>

<p>
Based on Plone 4.1, <code>five.grok</code>.  It is not based on any template engine:
just clone and go.  Tries to be as minimal as possible.

<a href="http://lists.plone.org/pipermail/plone-product-developers/2012-March/011388.html">asks</a>: "Did you have a look at the 'plone-customizations' egg
provided by <a href="https://github.com/plone/plone-devstart">plone-devstart</a>?
Wondering if it serves a somewhat similar purpose."
</p>

<p>
<strong>Cons</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It's opinionated, e.g. choosing CMF skin layers instead of <code>z3c.jbot</code> and
  views.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
"<code>plone-devstart.py</code> is a script to quickly and safely bootstrap a useful
Plone development environment."
</p>

<p>
At its simplest, this is similar to Alex's <strong>Hello Plone</strong>, except automated
and dynamic.  It tries to check whether a sane environment exists. 
</p>

<p>
More importantly, it can be updated as best practices evolve. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Pros</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Tries to encode best practices as running code. 
</li>
<li>
Supports various Plone versions.
</li>
<li>
Tries to accommodate your local setup (uses existing Python if suitable).
</li>
<li>
Requires only the standard Python library.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Cons</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Checks using heuristics. A Python that looks OK may still surprise you.
</li>
<li>
Reinvents <code>autoconf</code>/<code>automake</code> (but those are still complicated and not
  cross-platform).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Rather than a tool, this is a post describing and explaining a minimal set
of steps needed to go from nothing to a Plone instance with a new add-on.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Pros</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Minimal and informative.

</ul>

<p>
<strong>Cons</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Minimal.

<p>
Used to be based on <a href="http://pythonpaste.org/script/">paster</a>, now moving to
<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/templer.core">templer</a>. From a quick look it 
appears that the latest (3.0a1) isn't useful yet, so install with version 
specified as <code>&lt;= 2.99</code>.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Cons</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
It has accumulated quite a few crufty templates that are incomplete or
  haven't been updated to current development practices. 
</li>
<li>
It can be hard to figure out what exactly a template does or which is the
  right one to use for some purpose.
</li>
<li>
There are a lot of obsolete tutorials floating around. At the least there
  should be a ZopeSkel site which lists obsolete tutorials: a 
  "<a href="https://github.com/jean/ZopeSkel/wiki/Outdated-tutorials">don't read these</a>"
  list (quick wiki page). 
</li>
<li>
It's <a href="http://lists.plone.org/pipermail/plone-product-developers/2012-March/011319.html">unfinished</a>:
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
Our problem with ZopeSkel goes beyond keeping docs in sync. We never
finished ZopeSkel &lt; 2.99 -- as it has a zopeskel script that did not
support local commands -- and we decided to go with a new idea (templer)
with ZopeSkel 3.0 and that is in a zombie state (again, no local
commands), and then we saw this whole ZopeSkel situation deserved a new
approach (Crushinator) and that is also stalled somewhere.

<h2 id="toc_1.5">pip install</h2>

<p>
Support: "pip install -r 4.2.x.txt Plone" ASAP. Failures with this 
process become "general Python failures" not "Plone specific failures".
