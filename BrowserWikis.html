<h1 id="toc_1">Browser wikis</h1>

<p>
Wikis that live in a browser. 
</p>

<p>
There's <a href="http://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a>, mature and
well-thought-through. There are web-hosted options, but you can use it
offline entirely, or share privately via Dropbox. 
</p>

<p>
There's the 
<a href="https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki/">Smallest Federated Wiki</a>
by Ward Cunningham, web-only and focussed on federation. A wiki may span
servers. It also features simple data visualization and automation (I wonder
how this compares to tiddlers). Ward demonstrates running the wiki on
Arduinos to publish sensor data for both human and machine consumption.
</p>

<p>
Now Dave Winer's <a href="http://littleoutliner.com/">Little Outliner</a> has shown up. 
It looks like it shares many properties with these wikis. Storage is local,
interchange is via OPML export/import.
